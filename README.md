# Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢

This project predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using Machine Learning techniques in Python. It is based on the famous Titanic dataset and demonstrates a complete ML workflow including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## 📌 Project Description

The sinking of the RMS Titanic in 1912 is one of the most well-known tragedies in history. Using passenger data such as age, gender, ticket class, and fare, this project builds a predictive model to determine survival outcomes.

This project is ideal for:
- Beginners learning Machine Learning
- Practicing data preprocessing and EDA
- Understanding classification problems

## 🧪 Workflow

1. **Data Loading**
   - Load Titanic training and test datasets

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Analyze survival patterns
   - Visualize relationships between features and survival

3. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values
   - Encode categorical variables
   - Normalize or scale features if required
